# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
# books = Book.create([{ title: 'Star Wars', body: 'This is Description of Star Wars Book' }, { title: 'Lord of the Rings', body: 'This is Description of Star Wars Book' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
